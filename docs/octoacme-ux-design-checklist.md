# OctoAcme — UX Design Review Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure user experience designs meet usability, accessibility, and consistency standards before development begins.

## When to Use
- During initial feature design phase
- Before finalizing design handoff to developers
- When reviewing design changes to existing features

## Design Quality Checklist

### User Research & Validation
- [ ] User needs and pain points clearly identified through research
- [ ] Target personas and use cases documented
- [ ] Design assumptions validated with user testing or feedback
- [ ] Success metrics defined (e.g., task completion rate, time on task)

### Design Specifications
- [ ] Wireframes or mockups created for all key screens and states
- [ ] Interactive prototype available for complex workflows
- [ ] Design specs include dimensions, spacing, colors, and typography
- [ ] Edge cases and error states designed (empty states, loading, errors)
- [ ] Responsive design considerations documented (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text

- [ ] Clear calls-to-action and button labels
- [ ] Help text or tooltips provided where needed
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Undo/cancel options available for critical actions

### Handoff to Development
- [ ] Design files shared in accessible format (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
- [ ] Assets exported in required formats and resolutions
- [ ] Design review meeting scheduled with development team
- [ ] Developer questions and clarifications documented

## Design Review Meeting Template

**Attendees**: UX Designer, Product Manager, Lead Developer, relevant stakeholders

**Agenda**:
1. Review user needs and design goals (5 min)
2. Walkthrough of proposed design (15 min)
3. Discussion of technical feasibility and constraints (10 min)
4. Accessibility and edge case review (10 min)
5. Next steps and handoff plan (5 min)

## Post-Implementation Review
- [ ] Design implemented as specified (visual QA)
- [ ] Usability testing conducted with real users
- [ ] Feedback gathered and documented for future improvements
- [ ] Design system updated with new components if applicable
