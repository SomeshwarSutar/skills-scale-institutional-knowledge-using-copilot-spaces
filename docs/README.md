# OctoAcme Project Management Process Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! These docs provide comprehensive guidance on how we run projects at OctoAcme—from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Purpose

This documentation serves as:
- **Onboarding resource** for new team members to quickly understand our project management approach
- **Reference guide** for current team members working on projects
- **Collaboration framework** to ensure consistent practices across all teams
- **Living knowledge base** that evolves with our processes and learnings

Whether you're a Developer, Product Manager, Project Manager, or Stakeholder, you'll find the guidance you need to contribute effectively to OctoAcme projects.

## Our Project Management Approach

At OctoAcme, we follow a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery. Our process is built on these core principles:

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

### Workflow Overview
Our project lifecycle follows five key phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and align timelines
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team rhythm and tracking
4. **Release** — Deploy to production with proper verification and communication
5. **Retrospective** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Team Collaboration
We maintain regular communication cadences:
- Weekly sync between PM and Product Manager
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
